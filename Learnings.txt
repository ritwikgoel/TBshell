Fork:
Basically if the pid_t variable is not initiazed then its default value is 0, 
This is why the child of the forked process is 0. => as its literally just does not initialzes

waitpid():
Just waits for another process to execute and then after that continue the exeution.

exec:
This command replaces the current process image executes another process image.
This can be used to run other c programs from a program by calling it.
execvp calls anoher file and executes it (must be on the $PATH)
The first argument is the name of the command(In our case it becomes (args[0]))=> in case of "ls"
The second argument consists of the name of the command and the arguments passed to the command itself. 
It must also be terminated by NULL.
although the current text, data, heap and stack segments of the process are replaced, the process id still remains unchanged, but the program gets overwritten completely.
